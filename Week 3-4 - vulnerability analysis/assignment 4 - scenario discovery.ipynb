    "In this exercise, you will replicate the results from three influential papers in the field of decision-making under uncertainty. By working through these cases, you will gain hands-on experience in applying the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to identify policy vulnerabilities, develop Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), and design adaptive decision-making strategies.\n",
