    "In the previous week you used the lake problem as a means of getting acquainted with the workbench. In this assignment we will continue with the lake problem, focussing explicitly on using it for open exploration. You can use the second part of the [open exploration tutorial](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indepth_tutorial/open-exploration.html) for help.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is substantial support in the ema_workbench for global sensitivity. For this, the workbench relies on [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and feature scoring which is a machine learning alternative for global sensitivity analysis."

    "\n",
    "*hint: you can use sobol sampling for the uncertainties, and set policies to a list with the 3 different release policies. Next, for the analysis using logical indexing on the experiment.policy column you can select the results for each separate release policy and apply sobol to each of the three separate release policies. If this sounds too complicated, just do it on each release policy separately.*"
