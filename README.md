## Requirements
This repostitory is tested on Python 3.11. It has the same dependencies as the EMAworkbench (see [installation guide](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html)). Furthermore it uses [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) for many of the plots.

```
pip install -U ema_workbench[recommended] seaborn
```
