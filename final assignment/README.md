## Institution:

Delft University of Technology : Faculty Technology, Policy and Management.

### Purpose:

The data and the model are created for a project in the TU Delft course EPA141a - Model Based Decision Making. 
The project aims to find robust solutions for flood risk management on the IJssel river (NL) to better prepare the regions for flooding. 

# TODO
### General information:

write general information about the model (2 sentences,
write general approach (2 sentences), 
write that problem formulation three was used with constraints (1 sentence), 
explain kpi's of problem formulation three (opsomming)?

Key KPI's that are used include: 
- 

### Technologies used

The code is written and tested for Python 3.11. The specific packages used are given in the requirement.txt file. To use the code an environment for Python should be created and the packages stated in the requirements.txt should be installed. The data used is stored in .xlsx; .tar.gz;  and .csv formats, so a viewer that can read this format is required if only interested in data.

# TODO
### Purpose code files

Various Python files are included. Each has its purpose which will be briefly explained in the table underneath.

# TODO
### File structuring
The folder has a specific structure that is as follows:

    EPA141A-G010-final assignment/
        ├── archives/
        ├── data/
        ├── experiment/
        ├── img/
        ├── model/
        ├── notebook/
        └── report/

The data folder contains the data files needed and produced by the .py files and should look like:

    data/
     ├── 

The experiment folder contains the scenario results in CSV-format and should look like:

    experiment/
     ├── 
     

The image folder contains all the images generated by the visualisation.ipynb file. These images show and compare the scenario results and should look like: 

    img/
     ├── 

The model folder contains all the code files required to run the model and should look like this:

    model/
        ├─

The notebook folder includes the jupyter notebook which visualises the experimental outcomes. 

    notebook/
        ├── 


Lastly, the report folder contains the report that provides detailed information on the analysis conducted for the IJssel river case, as well as a political reflection. 

    report/
     └── report.pdf

# TODO
### Usage

If the file structuring is similar to the one given above the ... files are enough to access all the functionalities of the project code. 
Be aware: the directed search that was conducted is computationally expensive and was executed using multiprocessing on multiple cores.
